Learn By Doing Web App Architecture Proposal

I'll propose a comprehensive architecture for your "Learn By Doing" web application that focuses on interactive problem-solving. Let's start with an overview and then dive into each component.

High-Level Architecture
Here's a proposed architecture that balances performance, scalability, and development efficiency:

┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │      │                 │      │                 │
│  React Frontend │◄────►│  Python Backend │◄────►│    Database     │
│                 │      │                 │      │                 │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘

Detailed Components

1. Frontend (React.js)
Core Structure:
Single Page Application (SPA) with React Router
State management with Redux or Context API
Modern UI with Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
Key Features:
Interactive problem visualization (especially for geometry)
Step-by-step guided learning interface
Progress tracking dashboard
Hint system with progressive disclosure
Interactive drawing tools for geometry problems

2. Backend (Python)
Framework: FastAPI (high performance, async-capable)
Core Services:
Authentication service
Problem management service
User progress service
Hint/Solution validation service
For Geometry Problems:
Specialized geometry validation module
Dynamic problem generation
Solution checking algorithms

3. Database
Recommendation: PostgreSQL
Great balance of performance and features
Strong support for complex queries
JSON support for flexible problem structure storage
Excellent Python integration
Alternative: MongoDB
If you prefer schema flexibility for problem definitions
Good for rapid development and iteration
4. API Design
RESTful API structure for most operations
WebSocket connection for real-time feedback during problem-solving

Problem Data Model

Problem {
  id: string
  subject: string
  difficulty: number
  title: string
  description: string
  guidedSteps: [Step]
  practiceProblems: [Problem]
  hints: [Hint]
  solution: Solution
  prerequisites: [ProblemId]
}

Development Workflow
Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on:
Basic problem presentation
Simple guided walkthrough
One type of geometry problem (e.g., triangles)
Set up a development environment with:
Docker for containerization
CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
Development, staging, and production environments
