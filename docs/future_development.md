- **Interactive Problem Editor**: Create a WYSIWYG editor for problem creators to add new content
- **Problem Tagging System**: Allow categorization of problems by concepts, difficulty, prerequisites
- **Version Control for Problems**: Track changes to problems and allow reverting to previous versions

### Learning Experience
- **Learning Paths**: Curated sequences of problems that build upon each other
- **Mastery System**: Track concept mastery with spaced repetition for review
- **AI-Assisted Hints**: Generate contextual hints based on common misconceptions
- **Problem Generation**: Algorithmic generation of similar problems with different parameters
- **Visual Learning Tools**: Interactive diagrams, graphs, and simulations
- **Code Execution Environment**: For programming problems, include an embedded IDE

### User Experience
- **Gamification Elements**: Points, badges, achievements, and leaderboards
- **Social Features**: Collaborative problem solving, discussion forums, and peer reviews
- **Offline Mode**: Progressive web app capabilities for offline learning
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Custom views based on user preferences and learning goals
- **Dark Mode**: Alternative color scheme for reduced eye strain
