- [x] Add security utility tests
- [x] Create frontend test structure with Jest
- [x] Develop automated curl-based API testing script
- [x] Implement unified test runner for the entire project

## Current Status

The project has a working authentication system with the following features:
- User registration with email and username validation
- Secure password hashing
- JWT token-based authentication
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- SQLite database for development (PostgreSQL planned for production)
- Comprehensive test suite for backend components
- Automated API testing capabilities
- Frontend test structure in place

## Next Steps

### 1. Problem Management System
- [ ] Design problem schema
- [ ] Create CRUD endpoints for problems
- [ ] Implement problem versioning
- [ ] Add support for problem categories
- [ ] Create problem validation system

### 2. User Progress System
- [ ] Design progress tracking schema
- [ ] Implement progress tracking endpoints
- [ ] Create user dashboard API
- [ ] Add support for learning paths

### 3. Frontend Development
- [ ] Set up React project structure
- [ ] Implement authentication UI
- [ ] Create user dashboard
- [ ] Design problem-solving interface
- [ ] Implement progress visualization

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [x] Write unit tests for backend services
- [x] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Perform security audit

### 5. Database Migration
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL for production
- [ ] Create database migration scripts
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add database backup system

## Challenges and Solutions

### Current Challenges
1. **Development Environment**
   - Challenge: Managing different database setups for development and production
   - Solution: Using SQLite for development with plans to migrate to PostgreSQL

2. **Authentication System**
   - Challenge: Implementing secure token management
   - Solution: Successfully implemented JWT with proper expiration and validation

### Upcoming Challenges
1. **Problem Management**
   - Need to design flexible schema for different problem types
   - Must handle complex relationships between problems and prerequisites

2. **User Progress**
   - Need to design efficient progress tracking system
   - Must handle concurrent user progress updates

## Notes for Development

### Development Environment
- Backend running on port 8080
- SQLite database file: `learnbydoing.db`
- Virtual environment in `backend/venv/`

### API Endpoints
- Registration: POST `/api/v1/auth/register`
- Login: POST `/api/v1/auth/token`
- User Info: GET `/api/v1/auth/me`
- Health Check: GET `/api/v1/health`

### Testing
To test the authentication system:
1. Start the server: `source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080`
2. Access API documentation: http://localhost:8080/docs
3. Test endpoints using Swagger UI or curl commands

#### Automated Testing
The project now includes comprehensive test infrastructure:
- Backend unit tests: `cd backend && python tests/run_tests.py`
- API integration tests: `backend/tests/scripts/test_auth_api.sh`
- Frontend tests: `cd frontend && node src/tests/run_tests.js`
- Complete test suite: `./run_tests.sh`
