- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Perform security audit

### 5. Database Migration
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL for production
- [ ] Create database migration scripts
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add database backup system

## Challenges and Solutions

### Current Challenges
1. **Development Environment**
   - Challenge: Managing different database setups for development and production
   - Solution: Using SQLite for development with plans to migrate to PostgreSQL

2. **Authentication System**
   - Challenge: Implementing secure token management
   - Solution: Successfully implemented JWT with proper expiration and validation

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Challenge: Managing deprecation warnings in libraries
   - Solution: Updated code to use latest patterns and added warning filters in pytest configuration
   
4. **Test Reliability**
   - Challenge: Flaky tests due to test data conflicts
   - Solution: Implemented dynamic test user generation with random identifiers

## Notes for Development

### Development Environment
- Backend running on port 8080
- Frontend running on port 3000

### API Endpoints
- Registration: POST `/api/v1/auth/register`
- Login: POST `/api/v1/auth/token`
- User Info: GET `/api/v1/auth/me`
- Health Check: GET `/api/v1/health`

### Testing Infrastructure
- Backend tests using pytest
  - API endpoint tests
  - Service unit tests
  - Security utility tests
- Frontend tests using Jest and React Testing Library
  - Component tests
  - Service tests
- API integration tests using bash scripts
- Unified test runner script to execute all tests
- Fixed deprecation warnings for:
  - SQLAlchemy declarative_base
  - Pydantic v2 ConfigDict and model_rebuild
  - Datetime timezone awareness

#### Automated Testing
The project now includes comprehensive test infrastructure:
- Backend unit tests: `cd backend && python tests/run_tests.py`
- API integration tests: `backend/tests/scripts/test_auth_api.sh`
- Frontend tests: `cd frontend && node src/tests/run_tests.js`
- Complete test suite: `./run_tests.sh`
